app.py = backend code
 - to run this, point to the directory of this file and then run "flask run" in the terminal
  - this starts a flask api for the front end to hit




main.dart = frontend code
 - to run this, locate in vs code and switch to this tab then hit F5.
  - NB: need the flask api to be running for this to retrieve the data




Git:
- created new staging branch off of main
- created new 001_new_dropdowns off of staging

- workflow:
 - if like new updates, send to staging
 - after a collection of updates to staging, send to main




**Return Notes**
 - it works!
 - now work on final touches like look and feel 
 - then start porting to ios/android?
