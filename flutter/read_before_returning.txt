app.py = backend code
 - to run this, point to the directory of this file and then run "flask run" in the terminal
  - this starts a flask api for the front end to hit

 - right now i changed the df to be df.head(1000) because before this the dropdown wouldn't populate at all and the app would freeze
 - ** so returning to this we probably need the dropdown to be changed to a fuzzy search function and that narrows down the list for the user to select the course from



main.dart = frontend code
 - to run this, locate in vs code and switch to this tab then hit F5.
  - NB: need the flask api to be running for this to retrieve the data
